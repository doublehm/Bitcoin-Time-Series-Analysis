# Bitcoin Time Series Analysis ðŸ“ˆ

## Project Goal
This project is dedicated to the **analysis and forecasting of Bitcoin (BTC) price data** using various time series techniques and machine learning models. The primary objective is to leverage historical price data to identify patterns, evaluate model performance, and generate predictive insights into the future movements of the cryptocurrency.

The analysis is performed within a Jupyter Notebook, providing a clear, step-by-step documentation of the entire data science pipeline, from data acquisition and cleaning to modeling and visualization.

***

## Key Features

* **Data Acquisition:** Ingesting historical Bitcoin price data (e.g., OHLCV) from a reliable source (e.g., Kaggle, CoinGecko API, Yahoo Finance).
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing price trends, volume, volatility, and performing stationarity checks (e.g., Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test).
* **Time Series Modeling:** Implementation and comparison of classical and advanced time series forecasting models, such as:
    * **ARIMA / SARIMA**
    * **Exponential Smoothing**
    * **Prophet** (for incorporating holiday effects and seasonality)
* **Deep Learning (Potential):** Implementation of **LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks)** for potentially capturing complex non-linear temporal dependencies.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Measuring model accuracy using metrics like **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your system. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/doublehm/Bitcoin-Time-Series-Analysis.git](https://github.com/doublehm/Bitcoin-Time-Series-Analysis.git)
    cd Bitcoin-Time-Series-Analysis
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**
    (A `requirements.txt` file is recommended, but based on the libraries above, you can install them manually or generate one.)
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    # Add other model-specific libraries as needed (e.g., pmdarima, prophet, tensorflow)
    ```

### Usage

The core of the project is the Jupyter Notebook.

1.  **Start the Jupyter environment:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Open the **`Bitcoin.ipynb`** file.
3.  Execute the cells sequentially to run the full analysis, view the visualizations, and see the forecasting results.
